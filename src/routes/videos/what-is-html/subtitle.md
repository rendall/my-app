### Introduction
**Narration**:  
"Hi. This video will be a quick refresher on HTML"

---

### What is HTML?
**Narration**:  
"HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. An HTML file is a text document with a dot html extension."

**On-Screen**:  
Show a blank text document, then start typing "This is some text".

---

### (what are we seeing)

**Narration**:
"Here on the left is a text editor, and on the right is a browser that is showing the text file. When I refresh the browser, you can see that the text here on the left shows up on the right."

---

### Purpose of HTML
**Narration**:  
"Why not just use a text file? Well, HTML allows us to structure our content and tell the browser how to display it. It can also allow computers to understand the structure of the content."

"Here I am *marking up* this text with HTML. By *wrapping* this text in a <p> tag, I am telling the browser that this is a paragraph.  If I change the tag to \<h1\>, I'm telling the browser that this is a headline."

**On-Screen**:  
Refresh the screen, showing the visual difference between p and h1.

### What is a Tag?
**Narration**:  
"Before I go further, I should talk about what a *tag* is. Tags are the building blocks of HTML. They define elements and their properties. This `<p>` and `<h1>` are examples of *tags*.

**On-Screen**:  
Highlight tags `<p>`, `<h1>`.

---

**Narration**: These are examples of *open* tags, which means that it wraps content. Here is an example of a *closed* tag. 

**On-Screen**
Type out `<input/>` and refresh the screen.

**Narration**:
This is an input tag, and as you can see, it places a basic 'input field' on the web page.

### Role in Separation of Concerns
**Narration**:  
"HTML is only about structure. It works in tandem with CSS for styling and JavaScript for functionality."

---

### Minimum HTML Page
**Narration**:  
"Even though a browser can interpret this as HTML, a real HTML page has a few essential parts. Let's write one."

**On-Screen**:  
Type out a simple HTML page with `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>`.

---

### What is an Element?
**Narration**:  
"An element is a complete set of tags that make up a part of the page, like a paragraph or a header."

**On-Screen**:  
Highlight the <p>, e.g., `<p>This is a paragraph.</p>`.

---

### Difference Between "Tag" and "Element"
**Narration**:  
"A tag is part of an element. For example, `<p>` is a tag, while `<p>Text here</p>` is an element."

**On-Screen**:  
Show tags and elements side by side for comparison.

---

### What is an Attribute?
**Narration**:  
"Attributes provide additional information about an element. For example, `href` in a link."

**On-Screen**:  
Type out an `<a>` tag with an `href` attribute.

---

### Important Tags
**Narration**:  
"Some important tags you'll often use are `<a>`, `<img>`, `<div>`, and `<span>`."

**On-Screen**:  
Show examples of these tags in a code editor.

---

### Where to Learn More
**Narration**:  
"For a comprehensive list of tags and attributes, MDN Web Docs is a great resource."

**On-Screen**:  
Show the MDN Web Docs website.
